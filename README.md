## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. [E-Commerce Analytics Platform (dbt & DuckDB)](./ecommerce-dbt-project)
*A production-grade transformation pipeline built with dbt Core.*

This project demonstrates advanced data modeling techniques using real-world Brazilian E-Commerce data. It implements a full **ELT pipeline** transforming raw CSV data into a Star Schema optimized for analytics.

**Key Technical Highlights:**
*   **Architecture:** Implemented a layered architecture (Staging → Intermediate → Marts).
*   **Advanced dbt:** Utilized **Jinja macros** for currency conversion and surrogate keys to ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
*   **Data Quality:** Integrated custom generic tests to ensure referential integrity and positive revenue validation.
*   **Performance:** Built **incremental models** for fact tables to optimize processing costs.
*   **CI/CD:** Automated testing and documentation generation using GitHub Actions.
